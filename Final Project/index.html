            <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/es-es">Rocket League</a> is a high-speed sports-action video game that blends soccer with rocket-powered cars. 
            Players use aerial maneuvers and teamwork to score goals in intense matches. With multiple game modes and a thriving esports scene, 
            Rocket League is both accessible and highly competitive.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Car Choice Matters in Rocket League</h2>
        <p>
            Choosing the right car in Rocket League is crucial because each vehicle has a unique hitbox that affects gameplay. 
            There are six primary hitbox types: Octane, Dominus, Breakout, Merc, Plank, and Hybrid. These impact ball control, 
            aerial maneuvers, dribbling, and 50/50 challenges.
        </p>

        <h2>The Three Most Popular Cars</h2>

            <li><h3>Octane - The All-Rounder</h3></li>

            <p>
                The Octane is the most widely used car in Rocket League due to its balanced hitbox, solid ball control, and 
                effective aerial play. Its slightly taller design makes it ideal for 50/50 challenges, dribbling, and flicks, 
                making it a favorite among both casual and professional players.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Fennec shares the same hitbox as the Octane but has a more squared design, which improves ball control and 
                enhances 50/50 challenges. Its compact shape provides a more accurate feel, making it a top choice for competitive players.
